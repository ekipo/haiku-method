FB-03 ("ROLLOUT-AND-BASELINE-ESTABLISHMENT.md references SPA-UI-SPECS.md which is not in the design artifact set") hit the 3-bolt fix-loop cap. The designer fixes (inline description, then relative path + section anchor) did not satisfy the assessor; bolt 3 designer stalled at 600s without committing.

Root cause: the finding's premise (SPA-UI-SPECS.md not in the design artifact set) is borderline — SPA-UI-SPECS.md IS in the artifact set as unit-04's primary output. The fix should likely either (a) reject the finding as based on a stale premise, OR (b) restructure ROLLOUT-AND-BASELINE-ESTABLISHMENT.md to avoid the cross-artifact reference entirely. The unit specs need to clarify the inter-artifact reference contract so future reviewers don't re-flag this.
