## Finding

While fixing FB-10 (line 88), two additional instances of the non-existent `acknowledged_by` field were observed in the same feature file but outside FB-10's stated scope:

- Line 38: `And the new combined SHA becomes the next baseline entry with acknowledged_by "agent"`
- Line 46: `And the resulting baseline entry has acknowledged_by "agent" and acknowledged_via "agent-write"`

Per **DATA-CONTRACTS.md §2.1**, the `Baseline` schema has `author_class` (enum: `"agent" | "human-via-mcp" | "human-implicit"`) and `acknowledged_via` (enum: `"agent-write" | ...`) but NO `acknowledged_by` field.

## Required fix

- Line 38: `And the new combined SHA becomes the next baseline entry with author_class "agent"`
- Line 46: `And the resulting baseline entry has author_class "agent" and acknowledged_via "agent-write"`

## Why separate

FB-10 explicitly named line 88 only; FB-10 bolt 2 stayed in scope and fixed only that line. These two additional instances are the same defect class and need the same canonical-field fix.
