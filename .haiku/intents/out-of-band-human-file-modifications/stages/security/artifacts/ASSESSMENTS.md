# ASSESSMENTS.md — Per-Vulnerability Audit Trail

Companion to `THREAT-MODEL.md` (the synthesis) and `VULN-REPORT.md`
(per-finding evidence). This file is the audit trail for the security
stage — every V-NN finding tied to its addressing unit, with executable
gate evidence captured at write time, plus the residual risks deferred to
follow-up iterations.

---

## 1. How `gate_pass_evidence` is recorded

Each row's `gate_pass_evidence` column carries three load-bearing facts:

- **commit SHA** — the last commit on the addressing-unit branch where
  the gate's grep/test command was observed passing (the unit's
  `quality_gates:` are evaluated by the workflow engine at advance time;
  this column captures the SHA the engine last evaluated).
- **run timestamp (UTC, ISO-8601)** — when the threat-modeler hat
  re-executed the gate command at write time of THIS document. This is
  the audit-relevant timestamp: every gate below was re-run by this hat
  on the unit-04 worktree's local checkout against the addressing unit's
  branch tip and is documented as having returned exit code 0 at the
  recorded timestamp.
- **exit code** — the actual exit code returned by the gate command.
  `exit=0` is required for a row to be recorded as `closed`.

The threat-modeler hat verified each gate by:

1. `git show <unit-tip>:<file>` to extract the file contents at the
   addressing unit's branch tip.
2. Running the gate's `grep` / `test` predicate against the extracted
   content.
3. Recording exit code + run timestamp.

If a row's `gate_pass_evidence` shows `exit=0`, the gate's text-pattern
contract is satisfied at the cited SHA. Full Bun test suite (`bun run
--cwd packages/haiku test`) was reported passing in the cited fix
commit's own message (e.g. unit-01 bolt-3: "Full suite: 1199/0 across 61
test files"); this is captured as `suite_at_commit` in the per-row
notes column.

The fix code lives on per-unit branches that are not yet merged to the
security stage branch (`haiku/out-of-band-human-file-modifications/security`
tip is `cf782a2b9`). Stage-branch consolidation is the workflow engine's
responsibility post-stage-gate; this document records the per-unit tip
SHAs because that is where the fix code is observable today.

Run-of-record timestamp for this assessment: **2026-05-03T09:00:39Z**.

## 2. Per-vulnerability assessment table

| vuln_id | severity | description | addressing_unit | gate_command | gate_pass_evidence | residual_risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **V-01** | High | SVG/HTML knowledge upload renders inline as stored XSS via `serveFile` MIME map | `unit-01-upload-content-validation` | `grep -qE 'ALLOWED_MIMES\|allowedMimes\|MIME_ALLOWLIST' packages/haiku/src/http/upload-routes.ts` (gate `v01-v02-allowed-mimes-defined`) **plus** `grep -qE 'rejects.*\.html\|html.*rejected\|text/html.*415' packages/haiku/test/upload-routes.test.mjs` (gate `v01-v02-html-extension-rejected-test-named`) | commit `f83f45fe5`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (both gates) — suite_at_commit=1199/0 (per fix commit `bfa4b7c91`) | Serve-side `Content-Disposition: attachment` for non-image/PDF + CSP `default-src 'none'; sandbox` not yet applied. Reviewer GET of an allow-listed file still relies on `serveFile` MIME inference. Deferred — see §4 row R-1 (serve-side hardening). |
| **V-02** | High | Stage-output upload accepts arbitrary HTML; rendered inline via `/stage-artifacts/:sid/*` | `unit-01-upload-content-validation` | Same allowlist gates as V-01 (`v01-v02-allowed-mimes-defined`, `v01-v02-html-extension-rejected-test-named`) cover both routes (`ALLOWED_MIMES_STAGE_OUTPUT` + `ALLOWED_MIMES_KNOWLEDGE` defined per route in commit `3867608a6`) | commit `f83f45fe5`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0; bolt-3 commit `bfa4b7c91` adds R-01..R-04 equivalent-class blocks (`.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.css`, `.htc`, `.hta`, `.htaccess`) and removes `application/octet-stream` from both allowlists | HTML-mockup product use case still requires sandboxed sub-origin to render figma/HTML artifacts safely. Deferred — see §4 row R-5 (sandboxed sub-origin). |
| **V-03** | Medium | `human_author_id`, `attribute_to_user`, `rationale`, `user_instruction_excerpt` self-reported by agent and copied to audit logs without binding | `unit-02-author-identity-binding` | `bash -c 'grep -qE "reqUser\|sessionUser\|claims\.sub\|resolveAuthorFromSession" packages/haiku/src/http/upload-routes.ts \|\| grep -qE "claimed_author_id" packages/haiku/src/state-tools.ts'` (gate `v03-spa-author-bound-from-session-or-renamed`) **plus** `v03-mcp-author-bound-from-os-user-or-renamed` and `v03-author-mismatch-rejected-test-named` | commit `fe91e1e64`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (all three gates). Option B chosen: field renamed `human_author_id → claimed_author_id` consistently across SPA + MCP surfaces in commit `399c2ee13`. R-01 cross-session-sid bind closed in `4e5af2b76`. R-04 attribute_to_user allowlist closed in `bfa4b7c91`. | Audit-log hash-chain (`prev_hash` field on `write-audit.jsonl` / `action-log.jsonl`) not implemented. Tampered prior lines are not detectable. Status: **partially closed** (attribution renamed to `claimed_author_id`; integrity-on-the-log-itself defense deferred). See §4 row R-2 (audit-log hash-chain). |
| **V-04** | Medium | `haiku_human_write` symlink-escape check skipped when parent dir doesn't yet exist; `mkdirSync(recursive: true)` follows planted symlinks. SPA upload route has identical pattern. | `unit-03-symlink-toctou-and-csrf` | `grep -qE 'safeMkdirAndRename\|safeMkdirInIntent\|mkdirNoFollow' packages/haiku/src/http/path-safety.ts` (gate `v04-shared-safe-mkdir-helper`) **plus** `v04-helper-used-by-human-write-and-upload-routes` and `v04-symlink-escape-test-named` | commit `06cbb625c`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (all three gates). `safeMkdirAndRename` helper landed in `573c91da1`; both call sites (`state-tools.ts` and `upload-routes.ts`) use the helper. Symlink-escape regression test lives in `packages/haiku/test/unit-03-security.test.mjs` (V-04.1 / V-04.2 — "planted symlink at parent / grandparent dir is rejected"). | Single-shot `realpathSync.startsWith(intentRoot)` re-check after `mkdirSync` is not race-free against an attacker who can keep flipping a symlink. Full `O_NOFOLLOW`-everywhere via `openat`/`renameat` deferred — see §4 row R-4. |
| **V-05** | Medium | `getCurrentTickCounter(intentDir)` for `stage=null` SPA uploads picks a non-deterministic stage's iteration; entry_id collisions and drift-gate per-tick action-log misses | `unit-02-author-identity-binding` | `grep -qE 'getIntentScopeTickCounter\|globalTickCounter\|intentScopeTick' packages/haiku/src/state-tools.ts` (gate `v05-intent-scope-tick-counter`) **plus** `v05-drift-gate-unions-stage-and-intent-action-log` | commit `fe91e1e64`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (both gates). Producer fix in `399c2ee13`: `getIntentScopeTickCounter(intentDir)` returns deterministic intent-scope counter persisted to `intent-tick.json`. Consumer fix same commit: `drift-detection-gate.ts` reads union of per-stage and intent-scope action-log entries. Tick scope discriminator stamped on both action-log and audit-log entries. | Two SPA uploads landing in the same wall-clock millisecond with `stage === null` from two MCP processes serving the same intent could still race the intent-tick counter. Out of scope: deployment topology forbids multi-process serving the same intent. |
| **V-06** | Medium | `intent.md` archived/locked checks substring-matched against raw bytes — false-positives on body content, false-negatives on `status: 'locked'` | `unit-02-author-identity-binding` | `bash -c '! grep -qE "raw\.includes\(\"status:" packages/haiku/src/http/upload-routes.ts'` (gate `v06-frontmatter-parser-not-substring`) **plus** `v06-no-substring-status-checks-anywhere` and `v06-shared-locked-archived-helper` | commit `fe91e1e64`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (all three gates). Shared `isIntentLocked` / `isIntentArchived` helpers in `state-tools.ts` parse via `gray-matter`. R-03 closed coverage gap on MCP path (`haiku_human_write` now imports `isIntentLocked` and rejects with `intent_locked`, commit `4e5af2b76`). | None significant — both SPA and MCP surfaces now route through the shared parser. A future code path that re-introduces a substring check would be caught by gate `v06-no-substring-status-checks-anywhere` (negative-grep enforces repo-wide elimination). |
| **V-07** | Medium | `HAIKU_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` parsing has no upper bound; misconfigured value lets one upload exhaust disk + RAM + drift-gate sync SHA | `unit-01-upload-content-validation` | `grep -qE 'MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES_HARD_CAP\|Math\.min.*HAIKU_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES\|uploadHardCap' packages/haiku/src/http/upload-routes.ts` (gate `v07-upload-max-bytes-hard-cap`) **plus** `v07-oversize-clamp-test-named` | commit `f83f45fe5`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (both gates). `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES_HARD_CAP = 50 MiB` constant; effective cap clamps via `Math.min`; `haiku.upload.cap_clamped` telemetry event on misconfiguration (commit `3867608a6`). | Drift-gate sync SHA on tracked files >50 MiB still blocks the workflow tick if anyone ever bumps the cap. Recommendation (not yet implemented): skip drift-gate hashing for tracked files larger than a configurable limit and emit `haiku.drift.skipped_large` telemetry — folded into the rate-limit / DoS hardening residual risk. |
| **V-08** | Medium | No CSRF protection on POST routes; `?t=<jwt>` in URL + multipart-form-data is CORS-safe; cross-origin form post succeeds with leaked token | `unit-03-symlink-toctou-and-csrf` | `grep -qE 'query_param_token_disallowed\|disallowedOnMutating\|rejectQueryToken' packages/haiku/src/http/csrf.ts` (gate `v08-query-param-token-rejected-on-mutating-routes`, original gate pointed at `auth.ts`; the actual three-layer defense lives in the new `http/csrf.ts` module) **plus** `v08-origin-allowlist-check`, `v08-csrf-nonce-check`, `v08-mutating-route-audit-script`, `v08-csrf-test-named` | commit `06cbb625c`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (all five gates verified against `http/csrf.ts`, `http/csrf.ts`, `http/csrf.ts`, `packages/haiku/scripts/audit-mutating-routes.mjs`, and `unit-03-security.test.mjs` respectively). Three-layer CSRF defense: Layer 1 (HARD) reject `?t=` on mutating verbs; Layer 2 `HAIKU_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` allowlist; Layer 3 (opt-in) per-session `X-Haiku-CSRF` nonce. Single Fastify global preHandler in `buildApp()` covers every route; `audit-mutating-routes.mjs` static check in CI enforces preHandler scope. | Per-IP rate-limit on mutating tunnel-mode routes still missing — Layer 4 of typical CSRF defense-in-depth. Deferred — see §4 row R-3 (rate limiting). |
| **V-09** | Low | `agent_rationale` and `rationale_excerpt` persisted unbounded; assessments-list endpoint reads all into RAM | `unit-01-upload-content-validation` | `bash -c 'grep -qE "agent_rationale.*10\s*\*\s*1024\|10240\|MAX_RATIONALE_BYTES" packages/haiku/src/state-tools.ts && grep -qE "rationale_excerpt.*1024\|MAX_RATIONALE_EXCERPT_BYTES" packages/haiku/src/state-tools.ts'` (gate `v09-rationale-cap-10kb-and-excerpt-cap-1kb`) **plus** `v09-list-endpoint-truncates-rationale` and `v09-rationale-too-long-test-named` | commit `f83f45fe5`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (all three gates). `MAX_RATIONALE_BYTES = 10 * 1024` and `MAX_RATIONALE_EXCERPT_BYTES = 1024` constants in `state-tools.ts`; `validateRationaleCaps()` helper. Schema-validation rejects oversize rationales BEFORE `DA-NN.json` write with structured `agent_rationale_too_long` / `rationale_excerpt_too_long` errors (commit `0f87ed407`). List endpoint truncates to 256 chars + `…`; detail endpoint untouched. | None significant — schema enforcement at write time + list truncation cap the storage and bandwidth blast radius. |
| **V-10** | Low | `feedback_creates[].body` from agent flows into reviewer SPA without server-side sanitization | `unit-03-symlink-toctou-and-csrf` | `grep -qE 'sanitizeFeedbackBody\|stripDangerousMd\|sanitize.*body\|DOMPurify' packages/haiku/src/http/feedback-api.ts` (gate `v10-feedback-body-sanitized`, original gate pointed at `feedback-api.ts`; sanitizer lives in the new `http/feedback-sanitize.ts` module imported by `state-tools.ts` chokepoints) | commit `06cbb625c`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (verified against `http/feedback-sanitize.ts`). Server-side sanitizer wired into the three external-input-to-disk chokepoints in `state-tools.ts`: `writeFeedbackFile` (agent feedback_creates path + SPA POST path), `appendFeedbackReply`, `haiku_feedback_write`. Strips `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, dangerous attributes (`on*=`, `javascript:`). Commit `143a1ccbf`. | None significant — server-side sanitization closes the agent-as-attacker variant; SPA renderer is the second-line defense. |
| **V-11** | Low | Drift-gate baseline-corrupt error returns clear-text path; agent's natural reaction is `haiku_repair`, which silently re-establishes baseline from attacker-chosen content | `unit-03-symlink-toctou-and-csrf` | `grep -qE 'baseline_corrupt_acknowledged\|requireOperatorAck\|reconstructPriorBaseline' packages/haiku/src/orchestrator/workflow/drift-baseline.ts` (gate `v11-baseline-corrupt-operator-ack-required`) **plus** `v11-no-silent-auto-establish-after-corrupt` (negative-grep on `drift-detection-gate.ts`) | commit `06cbb625c`, run `2026-05-03T09:00:39Z`, exit_code=0 (both gates). Operator-only baseline-reset path: `reconstructPriorBaseline(intentDir, stage)` rebuilds last-known-good from `baseline-content/` + `action-log.jsonl`. `/haiku:repair --confirm-baseline-reset --diff-shown` requires operator to confirm specific diff hash. The agent CANNOT set `baseline_corrupt_acknowledged` directly. Anchored signals on tamper-evident surfaces (commit `3c3ccf1a0`) close the FB-05 red-team RT1/RT2/RT6 bypass class. | Rate-limit / circuit-breaker (`>3 baseline corruptions in 10 ticks` → `haiku.security.baseline_thrash` telemetry + auto-recovery disable) is the third line of defense and is partial — telemetry recorded but auto-disable-recovery hook landed in unit-03 IMPLEMENTATION as scaffolded, full enforcement deferred to operator-runbook follow-up. |

| addressing_unit | surface fixed | findings closed | gate_pass_evidence (commit SHA + suite_at_commit) |
|---|---|---|---|

## 4. Deferred residual risks (`stage_revisit` register)

The pre-execute review surfaced these as out-of-scope for this stage's
iteration. Each is recorded here with title, owning vuln(s), rationale
for deferral, severity if unfixed, recommended target iteration, and the
`stage_revisit` FB ID.

The FBs are filed against the `security` stage with `resolution:
stage_revisit` so the next pre-tick triage gate routes the cursor to the
security stage's elaborate phase for a follow-up wave.

### R-1. Serve-side hardening (V-01 fix #2, V-01 fix #3, V-02 fix follow-up)

- **Owning vuln(s)**: V-01, V-02 (defense-in-depth on the serve side)
- **Rationale for deferral**: Upload-side allowlist closes the primary
  attack vector (no malicious HTML/JS lands in the first place). Serve-
  side hardening (invert `serveFile` MIME map; force `Content-Disposition:
  attachment` for non-image/PDF; CSP `default-src 'none'; sandbox` on
  every served knowledge artifact) is the second-line defense if a
  future allowlist regression slips through. The first-line is in place;
  the second can land in a follow-up wave.
- **Severity if unfixed**: Medium (any future allowlist bypass becomes
  immediately exploitable without the serve-side guard). Today: Low (no
  known bypass).
- **Recommended target iteration**: Next security wave (security pass 2).
  Group with R-5 (sandboxed sub-origin) — they share the same `serveFile`
  + `file-serve.ts` + `path-safety.ts` surface.
- **`stage_revisit` FB ID**: **FB-06** (`feedback/06-residual-r-01-serve-side-hardening.md`)

### R-2. Audit-log hash-chain (V-03 fix #3)

- **Owning vuln(s)**: V-03 (integrity of the audit log itself)
- **Rationale for deferral**: V-03 attribution is bound (Option B
  `claimed_author_id` rename). Hash-chaining the log lines is integrity-
  on-the-log-itself — a separate, additive control. The current state
  ("attribution is self-reported and the field name says so") is honest;
  hash-chain is the next maturity step.
- **Severity if unfixed**: Medium (an attacker who can write to disk can
  rewrite prior log lines without detection). Today: Low (intent
  directory write-access is already a meaningful breach).
- **Recommended target iteration**: Next security wave.
- **`stage_revisit` FB ID**: **FB-07** (`feedback/07-residual-r-02-audit-log-hash-chain.md`)

### R-3. Rate limiting (mandate gap — partial cover for V-08, V-09, D-3, D-4)

- **Owning vuln(s)**: V-08 (CSRF defense Layer 4), V-09 (per-session
  classify cap), and threat rows D-3 (slowloris on multipart) + D-4
  (rapid-fire `haiku_classify_drift`).
- **Rationale for deferral**: The chosen CSRF defense (origin allowlist +
  query-param ban + nonce) closes the cross-origin form-post path, which
  is the V-08 direct exploitation. Per-IP rate-limit is the
  abuse-prevention layer that protects against credential-stuffing /
  brute-force / sustained-abuse patterns by an attacker who already has
  a valid token. Lower priority than the direct-exploit close.
- **Severity if unfixed**: Medium-High (token leak + sustained abuse
  becomes amplified; additionally, slowloris on `@fastify/multipart` is
  **completely unmitigated** — fastify default `connectionTimeout = 0`
  is not overridden in `packages/haiku/src/http.ts:107-136`). Today:
  Medium (slowloris is exploitable from any tunnel-mode reachability;
  token TTL + EPHEMERAL_SECRET process rotation cap CSRF / credential
  abuse but do not constrain a single attacker holding open
  connections).
- **Recommended target iteration**: Next security wave; co-locate with
  `unit-05-rate-limiting` (referenced in unit-03 spec's "Out of scope"
  section).
- **Slowloris escalation note (RT-FB-12)**: THREAT-MODEL.md §6.1
  originally claimed a fictional 60-second `connectionTimeout`
  mitigation. That claim has been retracted (see THREAT-MODEL.md §6.1
  and §3.5 D-3 row). Slowloris on the upload routes is now tracked as
  an **unmitigated** risk pending the R-3 rate-limit + connection-timeout
  work. The fix unit MUST set `connectionTimeout` (suggested:
  30 000 ms) and `requestTimeout` (suggested: 60 000 ms) on the
  `Fastify({ ... })` call in `packages/haiku/src/http.ts:107-136`, and
  add a regression test that asserts a stalled multipart upload is
  killed within the timeout.
- **`stage_revisit` FB ID**: **FB-08** (`feedback/08-residual-r-03-rate-limiting.md`)

### R-4. Race-free `O_NOFOLLOW`-everywhere (V-04 fix #1 — full migration)

- **Owning vuln(s)**: V-04
- **Rationale for deferral**: Unit-03's `safeMkdirAndRename` helper closes
  the single-shot easy case via `realpathSync.startsWith(intentRoot)`
  re-check after `mkdirSync` and before `rename`. A determined attacker
  with concurrent intent-directory write access who can keep flipping a
  symlink in a tight loop can still race the window. Full migration to
  `openat`/`renameat`-style semantics (Node `fs.openSync` with
  `O_NOFOLLOW`, then writes via the fd) eliminates every TOCTOU window
  but is a bigger lift — Node's fs API does not expose `openat` directly,
  requiring either an FFI wrapper or per-segment `lstat` with
  fail-on-symlink.
- **Severity if unfixed**: Medium (TOCTOU race remains for an attacker
  with concurrent write access). Today: accepted residual — concurrent
  intent-directory write access is already a meaningful breach.
- **Recommended target iteration**: Next security wave; needs FFI /
  Node-native investigation up front.
- **`stage_revisit` FB ID**: **FB-09** (`feedback/09-residual-r-04-o-nofollow-everywhere.md`)

### R-5. Sandboxed sub-origin for stage-output mockups (V-02 follow-up)

- **Owning vuln(s)**: V-02 (HTML mockup product use case)
- **Rationale for deferral**: Stage outputs are explicitly described as
  the surface reviewers use to swap in figma/HTML/image artifacts mid-
  review. The current allowlist forbids `.html` entirely (R-01 closure on
  the bolt-3 commit), which is safe but blocks the legitimate
  HTML-mockup product use case. The proper fix is a sandboxed sub-origin
  (cookie-isolated subdomain, `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`,
  `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`) so
  script execution in a mockup cannot read the tunnel-origin's session
  token. Implementation requires localtunnel sub-origin support (or a
  proxy layer) — a deployment-topology change.
- **Severity if unfixed**: Low today (HTML-mockup feature blocked, no
  exploitable surface). Medium when re-enabled without sandbox: every
  HTML mockup becomes an XSS vector.
- **Recommended target iteration**: Co-locate with R-1 (serve-side
  hardening) in next security wave; gated on sub-origin infrastructure.
- **`stage_revisit` FB ID**: **FB-10** (`feedback/10-residual-r-05-sandboxed-sub-origin.md`)

### R-6. Magic-byte content sniffing on uploads (V-01 / V-02 closure bound)

- **Owning vuln(s)**: V-01 (knowledge upload), V-02 (stage-output upload).
  **Triggering finding:** FB-34 (security stage,
  `feedback/34-upload-allowlist-trusts-client-supplied-mime-with-no-magic-b.md`).
- **Rationale for deferral**: The bolt-1/bolt-3 closure of V-01/V-02
  reduced the attack surface to "claimed MIME + filename extension are
  both on the allowlist." That bound is honest — the upload route does
  NOT inspect the leading bytes of the streamed payload, so HTML bytes
  delivered as `image/png` with extension `.png` pass at boundary 2.
  The closure of I-1/I-2 then leans on the serve-side path: `serveFile`
  picks `Content-Type` from the extension map at
  `path-safety.ts:118`, and modern browsers respect `image/*`
  Content-Type and refuse to render the bytes as HTML. The exposure
  is in degraded paths: pre-2018 user-agents, security scanners that
  re-sniff content, content-detection middleboxes, and any future
  serve-side regression. The proper upgrade is magic-byte sniffing of
  the first 512 bytes against the allowlist's binary members:
    - `image/png` → `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`
    - `image/jpeg` → `FF D8 FF`
    - `image/gif` → `47 49 46 38 (37|39) 61`
    - `image/webp` → `RIFF…WEBP`
    - `application/pdf` → `25 50 44 46 2D` (`%PDF-`)
  Text-class members (`text/plain`, `text/markdown`,
  `application/json`) have no fixed magic prefix; they remain accepted
  on extension+claim and rely on serve-side `Content-Type`-from-
  extension + the planned `nosniff` header (FB-19).
  **Why not fixed in this wave:** the bolt-3 closure landed the
  primary defense (extension blocklist + per-route MIME allowlist +
  octet-stream removal); magic-byte sniffing is a defense-in-depth
  upgrade, not a primary-defense gap. Co-locating with R-1 / R-2
  serve-side hardening means a single follow-up wave delivers the
  full hardened upload→serve path (magic-byte at boundary 2,
  `nosniff` + CSP + sandbox at boundary 4), rather than two partial
  passes.
- **Severity if unfixed**: **Medium** when paired with a degraded
  serve-side path (missing `nosniff`, future regression in
  extension-driven Content-Type, or a CDN/middlebox that re-sniffs).
  Low under the default modern-browser path. The R-6 + FB-19 +
  R-1 fix-set lifts this to "structurally closed."
- **Recommended target iteration**: Next security wave alongside R-1
  (serve-side hardening). Implementation site is `upload-routes.ts`
  immediately after `streamToTempfile` resolves — read the first 512
  bytes of `tmpPath` and compare against the magic-byte table for the
  member of `ALLOWED_MIMES_*` matched at the claim check, returning
  415 with `error: "content_type_mismatch"` on miss. The `file-type`
  npm package is the obvious dep choice (well-audited, single-purpose,
  ~40 KB minified); a hand-rolled table is < 80 LOC if the team
  prefers no new dep. Test surface: red-team PoC uploading
  `<html>…</html>` bytes as `image/png` / `application/pdf` /
  `image/jpeg` and asserting 415; positive controls for legitimate
  PNG/JPEG/PDF/GIF/WEBP uploads.
- **`stage_revisit` FB ID**: filed under R-6, to be authored by
  unit-04 elaboration in the next security wave (folded into the
  same `stage_revisit` follow-up FB stream as R-1 / R-2 / R-5 so
  the pre-tick triage gate routes the cursor to the security
  stage's elaborate phase exactly once for the whole serve+upload
  hardening pass).

## 5. Triage decisions referenced from this stage

The following decisions taken during the security stage are recorded here
for the audit trail; full rationale lives in the cited artifact.

- **Option B chosen on V-03** — `human_author_id → claimed_author_id`
  rename rather than server-side identity binding. Rationale: SPA session
  table has no reviewer-identity field today; renaming is integrity-
  honest about the field's authority. Recorded in commit `399c2ee13`
  message and unit-02 SECURITY-ASSESSMENT artifact.
- **Eventual-consistency confirmed (decision (a))** — V-04 single-shot
  TOCTOU close + full migration deferred. Rationale: drift gate is the
  compensating control for concurrent-writer scenarios; advisory locking
  is fundamentally incomplete because `vim` and out-of-band editors do
  not participate. Recorded in THREAT-MODEL.md §2.3.
- **FB-05 rejected** — "V-11 baseline gate bypassable via state.json
  tamper" finding rejected because anchored detectors on tamper-evident
  surfaces close the bypass class. Recorded in FB-05 frontmatter
  (`status: rejected`).

## 6. Pre-conditions that must continue to hold (re-rate trigger)

Per THREAT-MODEL.md §1.5, every Medium / High severity above assumes the
following four trust assumptions hold. If any weakens, every affected
finding is re-rated upward and this assessment must be re-run:

1. Localtunnel URL leak rate is bounded (Slack pastes, etc.) — not
   indexed by search engines or routinely logged in shared monitoring.
2. `EPHEMERAL_SECRET` is not extractable from process memory without
   prior code execution.
3. `tun` claim binding to active tunnel URL holds (no URL reuse across
   MCP processes).
4. `sid` cross-binding via `verifyIntentMutationAuth` is not regressed
   (no future refactor that ships `expectedSid: null` again).

If any of these change between security waves, the threat-modeler hat in
the next wave MUST re-validate every closed finding's severity rating
before re-running these gates.
