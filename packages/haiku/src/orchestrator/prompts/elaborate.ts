					"### One question at a time (NEVER batch)\n\n" +
					"Even when you have multiple questions, ask ONE, wait for the answer, then ask the next. Cognition breaks down for both sides if a deeper conversation has to happen on each — batched questions get half-answers and lose context when any one branches.\n\n" +
					'- **DO**: `AskUserQuestion({ question: "Auth strategy?", options: [...] })` → wait → `AskUserQuestion({ question: "Database?", options: [...] })`.\n' +

					"### Honest no-decisions declaration\n\n" +
					'If the work is purely conventional with NO architectural choices in scope (a doc update following an established style guide; a routine ops runbook against a fixed pipeline), call `haiku_decision_record { intent: "...", no_decisions: true, rationale: "<why this stage has no choices>" }` and proceed. **Faking a decision to satisfy the gate is the failure mode this design exists to prevent** — be honest.\n\n' +

					"| Specs, comparisons, detailed options (markdown) | `ask_user_visual_question` MCP tool |\n" +
					"| Visual artifacts, wireframes, designs | `ask_user_visual_question` with `image_paths` |\n" +
					"| Design direction with previews | `pick_design_direction` MCP tool |\n\n" +

				: "Mode: **autonomous** — elaborate independently. When you DO need user input (genuine blockers, ambiguity that the codebase can't resolve), use `AskUserQuestion` with pre-selected `options[]` — never plain-text option lists.

		}**Elaboration produces the PLAN, not the deliverables:**\n1. Research the problem space and write discovery artifacts to \`knowledge/\`\n2. Define units with scope, completion criteria, and dependencies — NOT the actual work product\n   - A unit spec says WHAT will be produced and HOW to verify it\n   - The execution phase produces the actual deliverables\n   - Do NOT write full specs, schemas, or implementations during elaboration\n3. Write unit files to \`.haiku/intents/${slug}/stages/${stage}/units/\`\n4. Call \`haiku_run_next { intent: "${slug}" }\` — the orchestrator validates and opens the review gate\n\n**Unit file naming convention (REQUIRED):**\nFiles MUST be named \`unit-NN-slug.md\` where:\n- \`NN\` is a zero-padded sequence number (01, 02, 03...)\n- \`slug\` is a kebab-case descriptor (e.g., \`user-auth\`, \`data-model\`)\n- Example: \`unit-01-data-model.md\`, \`unit-02-api-endpoints.md\`\n\nFiles that don't match this pattern will not appear in the review UI and will block advancement.`,
