// orchestrator/prompts/feedback_dispatch.ts — Pending feedback on
// a stage that DOESN'T require rolling the stage back. The
// orchestrator classified each item by resolution and emitted a
// dispatch plan: needs_triage, questions, inline_fixes, and
// upstream_rewinds. Each category is handled differently. The
// `message` field carries the per-item playbook the orchestrator
// rendered.
