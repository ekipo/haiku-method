// orchestrator/prompts/spec_review.ts — Spec-conformance gate review.
//
// Runs BEFORE the parallel quality-review layer. Only spec-gate agents
// (frontmatter `spec_gate: true`) are dispatched here. Their mandate is
// cross-unit / intent-level spec conformance — did the units collectively
// deliver exactly what was scoped?
//
// Findings are persisted via haiku_feedback (not inline). Any open spec
// finding routes through the fix loop before quality review fires.
//
// Why separated from review.ts? Spec correctness gates quality relevance.
// Burning tokens on architecture / security / test-quality review against
// a wrong implementation wastes review capacity and pollutes the fix loop
// with orthogonal concerns.
