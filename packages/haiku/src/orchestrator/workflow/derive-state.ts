// orchestrator/workflow/derive-state.ts — Pure function: read disk →
// return current workflow state name + minimal context.
//
// The function never writes; it only reads. Every call is a fresh
// snapshot of the on-disk state. Callers (workflow tick dispatch,
// visualization, debugging) consume the result without affecting
// future calls.
//
// Derivation returns the COARSE state name and lets the per-state
// handler in handlers/ do the finer-grained branching at runtime
// (DAG topology, pending-feedback scans, fix-chain reconciliation,
// etc.). This is the contract:
//   - Derivation answers: "which state node am I conceptually in?"
//   - The handler answers: "given my current context, what action
//     should the orchestrator emit?"
//
// The split keeps derivation testable in isolation — fixtures only
// need to set the fields derivation reads.
