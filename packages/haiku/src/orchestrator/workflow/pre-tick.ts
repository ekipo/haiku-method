// orchestrator/workflow/pre-tick.ts — Cross-cutting consistency check
// that runs BEFORE deriveCurrentState on every tick.
//
// The original runNext interleaved this check with phase routing —
// the check could (a) synthesize completion records for empty prior
// stages, (b) regress an execute-phase stage to elaborate when units
// lack inputs, (c) reset active_stage backwards to the first
// incomplete prior. Each of those mutations changes what the next
// derive-state call would return.
//
// To preserve that semantics under the per-state workflow handler dispatch
// (which routes by phase, not by "consistency check first"), the
// check lives here and runs as a pre-pass. If it produces a
// safe_intent_repair action, the tick short-circuits with that
// action. Otherwise the mutations land on disk and runWorkflowTick
// continues into derive-state on the now-consistent intent.
