// orchestrator/workflow/run-tick.ts — Workflow-engine tick. Read disk
// → derive current state → run pre-tick consistency repair → dispatch
// the per-state handler → return the action.
//
// This is the runtime entry point for the H·AI·K·U workflow engine.
// State of record is on disk (intent.md frontmatter + per-stage
// state.json files); each tick is a fresh derive-from-disk →
// dispatch → emit cycle. There is no in-memory state machine, no
// long-lived actor — the durability + replayability comes from the
// fact that every tick reads its own truth.
//
// Per-state handlers live in `handlers/{state}.ts`. The registry in
// `handlers/index.ts` maps state names to handlers. Adding a new
// state name = adding the entry to the registry + the file.
